<div id="q1">
&bull; [<span id="total_1">4</span> points] Imagine a world where each person has <span id="branch_1"></span> friends. Alice and Bob are \(d\) = <span id="level_1"></span> "friendship links" away (i.e. if \(d\) = 1, Alice and Bob are friends; if \(d\) = 2, there is a third person X such that Alice and X are friends, and Bob and X are friends; and so on). Imagine a breadth first search (BFS) algorithm that has access to the friendship links. The algorithm starts at Alice and the goal is to find Bob. In the worst case, how many people (the same person visited multiple times are counted as multiple visits) the algorithm needs to visit (including Alice and Bob)? <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2018 Midterm Q1, Fall 2016 Midterm Q1, Fall 2010 Final Q3. If the goal is the "last" node visited, then the number of nodes visited is the same as the total number of nodes in a complete tree with depth \(d\) and branching factor \(b\), which is \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{d} b^{i}\). <br>

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2018 Midterm Q2, Fall 2017 Final Q13. Suppose the successors are \(a n, a n + 1, ...\), then start from the goal state \(g\), look at the remainder when \(g\) is divided by \(a\) to figure out which integer is its "predecessor" and do this repeatedly until the initial state is reached. <br>

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2018 Midterm Q3. Since there are only four tiles, there is no way to change the ordering of the tiles: starting from 0, write down the numbers from the matrix in the clockwise order, the ones that are the same as the goal state can reach the goal state. <br>

<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2018 Midterm Q5. Every time node 0 is checked, DFS restarts with depth increased by one. Split the expansion path by the 0s to figure out which nodes are at each depth, and draw the tree accordingly. <br>

&bull; [<span id="total_6">2</span> points] Consider n + 1 = <span id="n_6"></span> + 1 states. The initial state is 1, the goal state is n. State 0 is a dead-end state with no successors. For each non-0 state i, it has two successors: i + 1 and 0. There is no cycle check nor CLOSED list (this means we may expand (or goal-check) the same nodes many times, because we do not keep track of which nodes are checked previously). How many goal-checks will be performed by Breadth First Search? Break ties by expanding the node with the smaller index first. <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2017 Final Q24, Fall 2016 Midterm Q2. Draw the tree with a small \(n\) and find the pattern. At depth \(0\), only 0 is search, and at each depth \(d > 0\), 0 is always searched first, then \(d\) is searched. <br>

&bull; [<span id="total_7">2</span> points] Consider a search graph which is a tree, and each internal node has <span id="b_7"></span> children. The only goal node is at depth <span id="d_7"></span> (root is depth 0). How many total goal-checks will be performed by Iterative Deepening Search in the luckiest case (i.e. the smallest number of goal-checks)? If a node is checked multiple times you should count that multiple times. <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2018 Midterm Q5. When the depth limit is \(i\), every node in the tree limited to depth \(i\) are searched, so \(\displaystyle\sum_{i'=0}^{i} b^{i'}\) nodes are searched in iterations \(i = 0, 1, ..., d - 1\). In the luckiest case, the goal node is on the first path when the depth limit is \(d\), so at least \(d + 1\) nodes are searched in iteration \(i = d\). <br>

<div id="q8">
&bull; [<span id="total_8">2</span> points] Recall in uniform-cost search, each node has a path-cost from the initial node (sum of edge costs along the path), and the search expands the least path-cost node first. Consider a search graph with \(n\) = <span id="n_8"></span> nodes: \(1, 2, ..., n\). For all \(1 \leq&nbsp; i < j \leq&nbsp; n\), there is a directed edge from \(i\) to \(j\)&nbsp; with an edge cost <span id="cost_8"></span>. The initial node is 1, and the goal node is \(n\). How many (unique) goal-checks (the same nodes expanded twice is counted only once) with uniform-cost search perform? Break ties by expanding the node with the smaller index first. <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2016 Final Q2. Draw the graph with a small \(n\) and find the pattern. Since there is a node between node 1 and every other node, all nodes with an edge cost to node 1 that is less than the minimum cost of the whole graph (or equal to the minimum cost and with a smaller index) will be visited at least once during UCS. Here, all nodes satisfy this condition, so all \(n\) of them will be visited. <br>

&bull; [<span id="total_9">2</span> points] Consider a search tree where the root is at depth 0, each internal node has <span id="b_9"></span> children, and all leaves are at depth <span id="D_9"></span>. There is a single goal state at depth <span id="d_9"></span>. How much <span id="complex_9"></span> (in number of states including the root and the goal) is sufficient so <span id="method_9"></span> always succeeds? Select all that applies. <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2017 Midterm Q4, Fall 2017 Midterm Q5, Fall 2016 Final Q1, Fall 2006 Midterm Q6. The worst case is when the goal is the last node at depth \(d\). BFS time complexity: \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{d} b^{i}\), space complexity: \(b^{d}\). DFS time complexity: \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=}\left(D-d+1\right)^{D} b^{i} + 1\), space complexity: \((b - 1) D + 1\). IDS time complexity: \(\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{d} \left(d + 1 - i\right) b^{i}\), space complexity: \((b - 1) d + 1\). Please check to make sure that these are correct!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
