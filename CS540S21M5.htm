&bull; [<span id="total_4">3</span> points] Consider a training set with 8 items. The first dimension of their feature vectors are: <span id="x_4"></span>. However, this dimension is continuous (i.e. it is a real number). To build a decision tree, one may ask questions in the form "Is \(x_{1} \geq&nbsp; \theta\)"? where \(\theta\) is a threshold value. Ideally, what is the maximum number of different \(\theta\) values should we consider for the first dimension \(x_{1}\)? Count the values of \(\theta\) such that all instances belong to one class.&nbsp; <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2016 Final Q11. At most one threshold between two consecutive distinct values is needed, for example, if the possible values are \([-1, 0, 1]\), at most one threshold less than \(-1\), one threshold between \(-1\) and \(0\), one threshold between \(0\) and \(1\), and one threshold larger than \(0\) are needed (four in total). <br>

If we require each leaf node to contain at least <span id="least_5"></span> training examples, what is the minimum size of the training set? <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2014 Midterm Q9, Fall 2012 Final Q6. The total number of leaf nodes in a complete tree is \(b^{d}\), and if at least \(n\) training examples are needed in each one of them, since the same training example cannot appear in multiple subtrees, there should be at least \(n b^{d}\) training examples in total. <br>

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2014 Midterm Q10. The entropy formula is \(H = -\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \log_{2}\left(p_{i}\right)\). Here, since the probability of drawing each of the \(n\) balls is the same, \(p_{i} = \dfrac{1}{n}\) for each \(i\). <br>

See Fall 2014 Midterm Q10, Fall 2006 Final Q11, Fall 2005 Final Q11. The entropy formula is \(H = -p_{1} \log_{2}\left(p_{1}\right) - p_{2} \log_{2}\left(p_{2}\right)\). <br>

&bull; [<span id="total_8">3</span> points] The RDA Corporation has a prison with many cells. Without justification, you're about to be randomly thrown into a cell with equal probability. Cells <span id="f1_8"></span> to <span id="f2_8"></span> have Toruks that eat prisoners. Cells <span id="f3_8"></span> to <span id="f4_8"></span> are safe. With sufficient bribe, the warden will answer your question "Will I be in cell 1?" What's the mutual information (we call it information gain) between the warden's answer and your encounter with the Toruks? (I didn't write the stories in these questions, so I don't know the reference too.) <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Fall 2012 Final Q5, Fall 2011 Midterm Q5. Compute the information gain based on entropy of Toruks (call it \(Y\) where \(Y = 1\) is the event that there is a Toruk in the cell) and conditional entropy of Toruks given whether you are in cell 1 (call it \(Y | X\) where \(X = 1\) is the event that you are in cell 1). Then the information gain is \(I = H\left(Y\right) - H\left(Y | X\right)\), where \(H(Y) = \mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 0\right\} \log_{2}\left(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 0\right\}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1\right\} \log_{2}\left(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1\right\}\right)\) and \(H\left(Y | X\right) = \mathbb{P}\left\{X = 0\right\} H\left(Y | X = 0\right) + \mathbb{P}\left\{X = 1\right\} H\left(Y | X = 1\right)\) where \(H\left(Y | X = 0\right) = \mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 0 | X = 0\right\} \log_{2}\left(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 0 | X = 0\right\}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1 | X = 0\right\} \log_{2}\left(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1 | X = 0\right\}\right)\) and \(H\left(Y | X = 1\right) = \mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 0 | X = 1\right\} \log_{2}\left(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 0 | X = 1\right\}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1 | X = 1\right\} \log_{2}\left(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1 | X = 1\right\}\right)\). Here, \(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1\right\}\) is the probability that there is a Toruk (i.e. the number of Toruks divided by the number of cells), \(\mathbb{P}\left\{X = 1\right\}\) is the probability that you are in cell 1 (i.e. 1 divided by the number of cells), \(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1 | X = 1\right\}\) is the probability that there is a Toruk given you are in cell 1 (which is always 1), and \(\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = 1 | X = 0\right\}\) is the probability that there is a Toruk given you are not in cell 1 (i.e. the number of Toruks not in cell 1 divided by the number of cells that are not cell 1). <br>

What is the decision boundary associated with this training set using 3NN (3 Nearest Neighbor)? <br>
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See Spring 2017 Midterm Q6. The decision boundary is the threshold such that all points on its left is classified as positive, and all points on its right is classified as negative. The threshold should be equidistant from the first and fourth points (i.e. the midpoint between the first and fourth points). <br>
